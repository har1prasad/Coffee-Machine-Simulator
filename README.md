### Project Name: Coffee Machine Simulator

The Coffee Machine Simulator project showcases two implementations of a coffee vending machine: one using a procedural programming approach and the other using object-oriented programming (OOP). Both versions provide the same core functionality, allowing users to select drinks, insert coins, and manage resources, while illustrating the differences between procedural and OOP paradigms.

### Implementations:

#### 1. Procedural Implementation:
The procedural version of the Coffee Machine Simulator uses functions to handle different tasks such as checking resources, processing coins, verifying prices, and making coffee. The main program flow is managed using conditionals and loops.

#### 2. Object-Oriented Implementation:
The OOP version encapsulates the functionality into classes and objects. This approach provides better modularity, reusability, and maintainability, it provides a more structured and scalable codebase, making it easier to extend and maintain.

### Purpose:
The main aim is to demonstrate the differences between procedural programming and object-oriented programming using a functional coffee machine simulator as an example.
