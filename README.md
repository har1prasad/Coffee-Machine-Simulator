# Coffee-Machine-Simulator
The Coffee Machine Simulator project consists of two implementations: one using a procedural programming approach and the other using object-oriented programming (OOP). Both versions emulate a coffee vending machine's functionality, allowing users to select beverages, process payments, manage resources, and track profits.
